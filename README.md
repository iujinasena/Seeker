## An Arduino based line following robot with obstacle detection
This was my final project of Robotic and Arduino Programming certificate course. There, I used two infrared sensors to detect the black line on the floor. A HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor was used to detect obstacles along the path and if an obstacle is detected, it will be alarmed through the blinking red led. I had to present this robot to a panel of judges at the end. It was a great experience for me.
